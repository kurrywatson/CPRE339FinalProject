Textual Description:  

We will be designing an app that solves the board game Clue as quickly as possible. When playing Clue, it is almost impossible to keep up with all the information available on such as what players made what accusations and what players showed to each other when. With an app, we can organize all the input and provide flawless feedback everytime. There is currently not an app that solves Clue so we would be doing something brand new. Players could use app to not only win at Clue, but a group could use this app just for the fun of seeing how quickly it solves the game and to realize how much information they are not using. Also, a player could approach Clue like a personal puzzle and could check whether they are solving it as quickly as possible by using this app.

App Flow:
1. User will say how many players there are and how many cards each player has  
2. User will input his cards  
3. Everytime a player makes an accusation, the user willl input it into the app  
4. The app will update and let you know what it knows about the game  
5. This continues until app let's you know when it has solved the puzzle
